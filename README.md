# Fake News Detection

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real.

## Project Overview

The Fake News Detection project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to differentiate between fake and real news articles. The main steps in the project include:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Model Training using Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of news articles labeled as "fake" or "real." The dataset includes features such as the title, text, and labels of the articles. The data is preprocessed to clean and prepare it for feature extraction.
